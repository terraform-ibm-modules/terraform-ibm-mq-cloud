# MQ on Cloud user

IBM MQ on Cloud makes a distinction between Administrators and Applications - which in IAM terminology are equivalent to Users and Service IDs. Both these entities are capable of accessing an IBM MQ queue manager but they are in different groups and have different access rights.

Administrators are given an IAM access policy which automatically adds them to the standard mqm group for all queue managers in their service instance, and therefore they have full administrator access rights.

  version               = "X.X.X"  # Replace "X.X.X" with a release version to lock into a specific release
  service_instance_guid = "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111" # MQ on Cloud deployment instance guid
  name                  = "user"
